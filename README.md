# Welcome to the QueenB Projects Repository üë©‚Äçüíª‚ú®

This repository showcases example projects developed throughout the year as part of the QueenB program. These projects were created to serve as references for the program participants before they build their own versions. The goal is to provide inspiration, guidance, and hands-on coding experience to empower young girls to enter the tech industry.

# About QueenB

QueenB works to create a future in which women are equally active in the hi-tech industry, influence it, and lead in it. Through hands-on coding experience, mentorship, and community support, we strive to bridge the gender gap in technology and provide young women with the skills and confidence to succeed.
